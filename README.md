### Description
This project aimed to create a web-based application that is both straightforward and beneficial, specifically tailored for individuals recovering from strokes. Stroke survivors often experience impaired fine-motor skills, significantly impacting their ability to perform various essential daily activities. Studies have shown that strokes can cause brain damage, leading to weakness on one side of the body. To facilitate brain rewiring post-stroke, repetitive movements are crucial. The application we developed incorporates these movements into its design, offering a potential aid for stroke patients in regaining their fine-motor skills. It comprises three key activities: navigating and selecting apps on a smartphone, typing exercises, and practicing handwriting.
